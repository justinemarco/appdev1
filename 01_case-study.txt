As a manager, it is vital to ensure the success of the project and the welfare and well-being 
of the team members. As the case may be when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects 
the project timeline, offering support and understanding the predicament of his/her situation is 
necessary and if they need to take some time off or consider a short-term leave that would 
help them recollect themselves without being pressured on the project would make them feel supported, 
potentially leading to a quicker recovery. 

In addressing the issue in terms of keeping the project on track, 
it is important first to assess the impact this may have on the project timeline 
and the resources now available. Taking into consideration and assessing 
how much work still needed to be done, redistribution of tasks among the remaining team members,
 and the additional resources needed to be able to accomplish the project on time. 
 Finding out if any members of the team can temporarily fill in the shoes in the absence of 
 another team member may also be possible to ensure the project stays on track. 
 As you are working with a team, offer transparent communication with the 
 Research and Development Department by explaining the situation of your project team constructively, 
 and updating them on the adjustments made to the project plan to keep the project on track. 
 Addressing as well the issues, problems, or delays that may or have arisen along the way can show 
 vulnerability and honesty, deeming you with integrity. Lastly, encouraging the team and recognizing 
 their efforts and hard work to keep the project afloat can motivate them to stay focused and driven 
 despite being under pressure. Fostering a supportive and empathetic environment and culture, 
 especially towards the project team may lead to better results despite the stress and pressure.

As a developer facing a family emergency, making efforts to minimize the impact of my personal 
needs on the team and project timeline is essential. Talking to the project manager and having 
to explain the emergency and discuss the time I would need to handle my family predicament privately, 
discussing as well the potential impact this may have on my availability and to the tasks assigned to me 
that would be affected. Once this has been settles, creating a list of my current tasks and project 
deliverables, especially critical tasks, in order to guide the person or team member who is going to 
step in my shoes to understand where I left off easily. If the situation allows and has improved, 
I would check in on my team members, especially to the one filling in on my tasks, to offer guidance 
or help where I am needed. This helps my team to see my commitment and minimize any more disruptions 
for the team. Once my situation has alleviated, I would request the project manager to return to work 
and work on any other remaining tasks and other ones to catch up on my shortcomings for the team, 
lending out help whenever I possibly can.

What Could Have Been Done Better?

First, during the initial project planning, It would have been better if a ore detailed risk assessment
could have been conducted, given the fact that the project timeline was tight and deadlines were fast 
approaching, as well as the steep learning curve. Including as well the identification of personal and 
scheduling risk and planning contingencies for each would help the team address the issues more 
efficiently. Second, recognizing the learning curve and the potential reliance on specific individuals, 
cross training some team members on critical tasks and sharing knowledge would have created a backup 
capacity within the team. This can be done either during the meeting wherein there is a dedicated time 
for knowledge sharing. Third, frequent check-ins might have helped address or identify any emerging 
issues, including personal or workload challenges. If there was an open and fostering environment that
would potentially made the team member open up about his/her situation earlier, the team could have 
adjusted plans sooner. Last but not the least, communicating with the Research ad Development department 
about the possible risks and updating them through regular check-ins would have built a stronger 
collaborative partnership, making them anticipate a more potential delay.
